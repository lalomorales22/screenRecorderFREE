Project Brief: Screen Recording Application

1. Software Concept:

	•	Purpose: Create an intuitive screen recording application allowing users to capture entire screens, specific application windows, or selected areas. The app should provide options to save recordings in popular formats (e.g., MP4, GIF) and support sharing functionalities.
	•	Core Features:
	•	Selectable recording regions: entire screen, specific window, or custom area.
	•	Option to record audio from a microphone or system audio.
	•	Adjustable recording quality and frame rate.
	•	Easy-to-use UI with start, pause, and stop recording options.
	•	Options to save, export, and manage recorded files.
	•	Optional in-app editing for basic trimming, annotation, and watermarking.
	•	Target Users: Designed for general users, professionals, educators, and content creators who need quick and reliable screen recording capabilities with minimal setup.

2. Technical Overview:

	•	Tech Stack:
	•	Frontend:
	•	Electron for cross-platform desktop application development, allowing the app to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
	•	React (optional) for UI development within Electron to ensure a modular and interactive user interface.
	•	Backend:
	•	Node.js for handling file operations and communicating with system-level recording APIs.
	•	Recording Functionality:
	•	FFmpeg (integrated via Node.js) for screen recording, format conversions, and video processing.
	•	MediaRecorder API (for web-based or limited Electron use) for capturing media streams if you choose a browser approach within Electron.
	•	Storage:
	•	Local File Storage for storing recorded files directly on the user’s device.
	•	SQLite (optional) for managing metadata about recordings (e.g., name, creation date, tags).
	•	Additional Libraries:
	•	Fluent-FFmpeg for easier FFmpeg integration in Node.
	•	File-Saver for handling file saving in Electron.
	•	Testing & Deployment:
	•	Jest for unit testing.
	•	Electron-Builder for packaging and deployment.

3. File Structure:

Here’s a recommended file structure for this app:

4. Project Overview and Technical Specifications:

	•	Project Scope:
	•	The application should offer basic screen recording functionalities with options for output quality, recording source, and recording destination. An in-app file manager will let users view, rename, and delete their recordings.
	•	Platform: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
	•	Interface: Simple, responsive UI using React and Electron for a clean, desktop-friendly experience.
	•	Technical Specifications:
	•	Recording Options: Full-screen, single window, or custom area.
	•	Audio: Microphone or system audio recording (optional).
	•	Video Quality: Settings for resolution, frame rate, and format.
	•	Output Formats: MP4, WebM, GIF for smaller recordings.
	•	In-App Editing (MVP): Basic trimming of recorded clips.
	•	File Management: Recorded videos can be saved in a chosen directory, with options for organizing and renaming.
	•	Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features:
	•	Basic screen recording with save and playback options.
	•	UI with start, pause, stop buttons.
	•	Save recordings in a standard format (MP4).
	•	Simple file manager to rename, delete, and preview recordings.
	•	Additional Features (for later stages):
	•	Annotation and drawing tools during recording.
	•	Advanced video editing (e.g., adding text, transitions).
	•	Integration with cloud storage for file backup.
	•	Hotkeys for quick access to recording controls.
